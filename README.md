Personal medium for note-taking, data management, hypertext, online messaging, and chatbot creation

I think of this as what HyperCard might have been had it been allowed to fully mature at Apple.

Web Search should be integrated

@Name refers to Contact entry by default.
@Names can refer to people, either by Handle, First/Last, or some other shorthand
@@Name would refer to a system, not a person)


Desirable features:
ActivityPub should be supported
Follow Apple's Human Interface Guidelines, but emphasize:
- avoid forcing switching between the keyboard and mouse

NelsonDoc support - in a later release
Choice of Scripting language
(Hypertalk. Lisp/Guile, etc)
